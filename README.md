# flask-tf-binding

### Introduction

Through this project, you can combine [MARGE](http://cistrome.org/MARGE/index.html) and [BART](http://faculty.virginia.edu/zanglab/bart/index.htm) together to do transcription factors binding prediction.


### How to use it

When the project is finished, please visit [MARGE-BART/zanglab].

Or if you want to run in your localhost, download those related projects, MARGE/BART/USCS_TOOLS. Install them, and change the conf.yaml file...

```sh
$ sh run.sh
```

However, those steps are complicated. So please wait for me to publish in a public IP. It worths waiting! :)
